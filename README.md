## What you built? 

I built a 2D game in java. The game has a 16-bit character and map as tiles. I created everything from scratch and followed a step by step tutorial on youtube.

The object of the game is to go around the map and collect keys and a powerup. With the keys you can uplock doors which will eventually lead you to a treasure chest. You win!

The game has sound, including a custom soundtrack and some sound effects. 

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

Worked alone.

## What you learned

I learned how to make a game in Java! I already know java pretty well, but this was a field that I didn't know to much about. It was fun learning about game clocks, resources such as images and sounds, and the math that goes behind everything. Everything went pretty smoothly and I hope to continue learning more about java games!

## Acknowledgments

I followed this tutorial series here -> https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq. I watched videos 1 - 9. Most of the code was copied from this video. While I wrote it all with my keyboard, much of the code is the same as what was written by the youtuber. 

For my custom art, I used https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create/sprite.

For my custom soundtrack, I used www.beepbox.co

For the sound effects coin.wav, fanfare.wav, powerup.wav, and unlock.wav I used https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xelhONaiD3G12z9J3N6BqVR6Ts08pRwg
